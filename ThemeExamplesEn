With the development of neural networking techniques, several architectures for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix learning
Nevertheless, it has no temporal dimension so that there is no latency within training and inference phases as BNNs
Therefore, to improve the quality of biclustering and module extraction, this work combines the adaptive resonance theory (ART)-based methods of biclustering ARTMAP (BARTMAP) and topological ART
The proposed algorithm is hybridized by the Convolutional Neural Network and the Gated Recurrent Unit algorithms
Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and demonstrate it achieves better performance in detecting dynamic FC (dFC)
To generalize the Tucker network into a deep version, we combine the hierarchical Tucker format and Tucker format to propose a deep Tucker tensor decomposition
Deep neural networks have achieved great success in solving many machine learning and computer vision problems
To address this issue, we seek to explicitly enhance the semantic relation among instances on the targeted downstream task and provide a better initialization for the subsequent fine-tuning
Artificial neural networks are a software code that imitates the work of a brain and is capable of self-learning. Like a biological network, an artificial network also consists of neurons, but they have a simpler structure.
An artificial neuron receives signals through several inputs, then transforms them and transmits them to other neurons. That is, the work of a neuron is to convert several parameters into one.
